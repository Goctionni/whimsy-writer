# Readme

Whimsy writer is a system for writing text-based, interactive, story driven games. You may already
be familiar with other systems like Twinewith Harlowe or SugarCube; Whimsy Writer is similar, but
also different.

How is it different? Primarily in terms of target audience. Whimsy Writer is intended for authors
who already have some technical experience. Ideally in frontend / webdevelopment, but if you've been
using SugarCube with a command-line tool like Tweego, you will also be able to pick this up quickly.

## Getting Started

In order to use Whimsy Writer, you will need to have npm/nodejs installed.

- [NPM/NodeJS Website](https://nodejs.org/en)

In addition, it is recommended to also have a modern code editor installed (such as VSCode).

- [VSCode Website](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Once you have the above ready, you can create a new "Whimsy-writer" project by running:

```bash
npm create whimsy
```

After running through the setup, open the directory thats been created in your code editor (VSCode),
and look for a file called `readme.md` for instructions on how to write and play your story.
